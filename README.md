# check_router
Given that I did not have access to control the device, I was forced to use the smart socket. 

Check if the Beeline router is frozen, and then reboot it via smart socket.
The smart socket was flashed with Tasmota open source firmware.
All actions are performed via an HTTP curl request to the Tasmola API.
